# Modeling different methods for generating ability scores

## Idea

There are several different methods for determining starting ability scores in TTRPGs (rolling, point buy, etc).

> Assuming abilities are normally distributed within the (human) population, how do these various methods compare to a normal distribution?

#### To do:

* Read and make a list of ability score methods
* Decide how to simulate rolling multiple characters
  * for point buy, I'll need to simulate all the scores at once maybe?
* compare to a normal distribution
  * mean and std dev for the different methods
* where do some of my and my friends' characters fall?
 
#### More ambitious/stretch?

* make character ability scores into a vector and look at spread that way?
* predict (pathfinder) class?

I am certain that this has been done many times before, and I know it's not a complicated project, but I thought it would be neat and would be good practice.
